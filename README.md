# Shazall

Identify all music being played using a microphone.

So now you can see what song is playing on the radio, in the TV show or movie you're watching, on your turntable, what the DJ is playing, what's playing in the record shop, or whatever.

And with the bonus feature of scrobbling everything, you no longer have to worry that people wonâ€™t know how exquisite your taste in music is when you're not streaming, it gets scrobbled anyway! 

Expect the whole installation to take about 30 minutes.

## Stuff needed:
* Raspberry Pi 3 or greater.
* Power cable.
* SD card.
* USB microphone. I used [MI-305](https://www.amazon.eg/-/en/MI-305-Mini-USB-Microphone-Black/dp/B0994PFKDD). Most similar microphones should work.
* LCD screen. I used [XPT2046](https://www.amazon.com/Resistive-compatible-Raspberry-Pi-Raspbian/dp/B00OZQS5NY) on RPi3 and [MHS-3.5inch RPi Display](https://www.lcdwiki.com/MHS-3.5inch_RPi_Display) on RPi4. Most similar screens should work.

## Install

Start by connecting the USB microphone and the LCD screen to your Pi.

### OS

[Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html), and make sure to enable SSH.

When booting the Raspberry Pi, the screen may stay blank, this will be fixed in the [LCD screen](#lcd-screen) step.

SSH into your Raspberry Pi and run the following command: `sudo raspi-config`

Go to `Interface Options > SPI` and select `Yes`

Go to `System options > Auto login` and select `Yes`

Choose `Finish`

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Packages

Now install the required packages:

```
sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-ui-mods git ffmpeg portaudio19-dev python3-pip
```

### LCD screen
To install support for the LCD screen, enter the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show.git
cd LCD-show
sudo ./LCD35-show
```

This reboots the machine automatically and should show the terminal login on the LCD screen. 

If the screen is upside down enter this command: `sudo nano /boot/config.txt` and under `[all]`, change `dtoverlay=tft35a:rotate=90` to `dtoverlay=tft35a:rotate=270` and save. Then enter: `sudo reboot`

Oddly, the LCD-show script removes raspi-config during installation. So now it's time to reinstall it: `sudo apt-get install raspi-config`

### Shazall itself

Next up is the install of Shazall itself. 

Enter the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/jonkpirateboy/shazall.git
cd shazall
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install sounddevice soundfile shazamio pydub pylast pillow
deactivate
sudo cp shazall.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/shazall.service
```

In this file change `[yourusername]` to your username.

If you need to change how long Shazam listens, the samplerate, or the screen resultion, you can do that in the `shazall-settings.json` file.

Then add this code to make Shazall autostart on boot:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable shazall.service
sudo systemctl start shazall.service
````

And then reboot the machine and you sould see Shazall listening: `sudo reboot`

### Bonus: Scrobble to Last.fm

* [Create an API account with Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)
* For `Application name`, choose whatever you like, for example `Shazall`. You don't need to fill out the rest.
* SSH into your Raspberry Pi 
* Edit the file `shazall-settings.json`, change `scrobble` to `true`, and enter your Last.fm credentials:

```
api_key = API key
api_secret = Shared secret
session_key = Leave empty
username = Registered to
````

Save and exit and, then we continue:

* Enter the venv: `source shazall/venv/bin/activate`
* Enter this command: `python3 shazall-lastfm-get-session.py`
* Enter your username and password when promted, the script will retrieve your session key and save it to shazall-settings.json automatically.

Exit the venv: `deactivate`

After reboot, or restart of the service, Shazall will scrobble to Last.fm.
